This is the initial main release for the hot-pepper-jelly, it will include all main functions of hot-pepper-jelly, which includes:

1. Auto proxy support
2. Registry Support(basic)
3. Global Registry Functions

Why it is 1.0.1? Because I push the 1.0.0 of the hot-pepper-jelly to npm long time ago for test. :P

# 1.0.2

This is the incremental release for the hot-pepper-jelly, it adds the class proxy white list and black list pattern support, so that when you are using the require way of hot loading, you can just hot load all modules, only the modules that you want to include
